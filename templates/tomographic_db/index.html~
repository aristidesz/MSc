        <p>SGLOBE-rani Model is a new global whole-mantle model of isotropic and radially anisotropic S-velocity structure. It is based on approximately 43,000,000 surface-wave and 420,000 body-wave travel time measurements which are expanded in spherical harmonics basis functions up to degree 35. The model takes into account short-period group velocity data with period range at 16 seconds. Thus, these data are strongly sensitive to the crust perturbations which are incorporated in the model. The isotropic S-velocity of the model are in a high agreement with previous upper mantle models. The anisotropic model is in an agreement with previous models; however; it shows some deviations for faster SV velocity along subduction zones at transition depths and faster SH velocity beneath slabs in the lower mantle.</p>
